// Regression test for INV-SEC-02 / Phase 1.3.
//
// The default diagnostics export (safe-summary mode) must not contain
// vault filenames or path-shaped strings anywhere in the output. This test
// drives the path redactor against a fixture shaped like the real
// diagnostics bundle, then walks the output recursively to assert no
// raw path remains. The fixture exercises:
//
//   - structural path fields (path, oldPath, newPath, etc.)
//   - path-list fields (missingOnDisk, missingInCrdt)
//   - free-form strings containing embedded paths (recentEvents.msg)
//   - heterogeneous server-trace shapes
//   - paths that are NOT seeded into knownPaths (must still be caught
//     by the regex during deep walk)
//
// A separate assertion verifies that the passthrough redactor (used by
// the explicit with-filenames action) leaves the bundle unchanged.
