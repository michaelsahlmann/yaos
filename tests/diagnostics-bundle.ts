/**
 * FU-5 — Service-level diagnostics bundle test.
 *
 * Tests buildDiagnosticsBundle() — the pure function extracted from
 * DiagnosticsService.runExport() in Phase 1.7. The function takes all
 * pre-gathered data as arguments and returns the redacted bundle with no
 * Obsidian I/O (no vault writes, no Notice).
 *
 * Invariants tested:
 *   Safe mode (includeFilenames: false):
 *     - host is "(redacted)", not the actual server URL
 *     - token: only { present: bool } — no prefix, no length
 *     - vaultId is "(redacted)"
 *     - deviceName is "(redacted)"
 *     - known vault paths do not appear anywhere in the serialised bundle
 *     - redaction.mode is "safe-summary"
 *     - leakDetected is false when redaction works correctly
 *     - leakDetected is true when a raw path is injected into the input
 *
 *   Full mode (includeFilenames: true):
 *     - host IS present
 *     - vaultId IS present
 *     - deviceName IS present
 *     - redaction.mode is "with-filenames"
 *     - leakDetected is false (passthrough redactor, no check performed)
 *
 * This test is intentionally Obsidian-free. It uses the obsidian mock alias
 * (for diagnosticsService.ts imports) and a real SHA-256 implementation via
 * Node's webcrypto.

	// quoted-path shaped in a string. However, the post-redaction check
	// searches the serialised output for the exact string.
	// NOTE: the deep walker DOES walk object values, so path-shaped strings
	// in log messages get caught by the regex. The true leak scenario is a
	// structural key whose value is a non-quoted plain path (e.g. object
	// field name "rawLeak" with value "Projects/secret-plan.md"). The deep
	// walker will redact this via string handling since it walks all strings.

	// bundle where the path is NOT redacted:
	// Use the passthrough redactor bypass: temporarily override includeFilenames
	// to force passthrough, which skips redaction but also skips the leak check.
